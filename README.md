## Introduction

The House-Price-Prediction project utilizes the Boston Housing dataset to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes. The project explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Boston Housing dataset, which includes various features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, and property tax rate. The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes (`MEDV`).

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amirhajif/House-Price-Prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd House-Price-Prediction
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). An MAE of 1.8909 indicates the average error in predicting the house prices in $1000s.
